Why Splunk?

- To understand the complex logs.
- For better look and feel.
- Splunk can store and process large amounts of data, data analysts.
- Dashboards meant for Great visualization.
- If you have a machine which is generating data continuously and you want to analyze the machine state in real time.



Components of splunk:
=====================
1) Search head  – provides GUI for searching

2) Indexer – indexes machine data

3) Forwarder - Forwards logs to Indexer

4) Deployment server - Manages splunk components in distributed environment

Splunk Indexer:

The indexer is the Splunk Enterprise component that creates and manages indexes. 
The primary functions of an indexer are:
- Indexing incoming data.
- Searching the indexed data.
- Picture


Splunk Forwarder & types:

There are two types of splunk forwarder as below
a) Universal forwarder(UF) - You can opt for an universal forwarder if you want to forward the raw data collected at the source. It is a simple component which performs minimal processing on the incoming data streams before forwarding them to an indexer.

b) Heavy weight forwarder(HWF) – You can use a Heavy forwarder and eliminate half your problems, because one level of data processing happens at the source itself before forwarding data to the indexer. Heavy Forwarder typically does parsing and indexing at the source and also intelligently routes the data to the Indexer.


Splunk licenses:

- Enterprise license
- Free license
- Forwarder license
- Beta license
- Licenses for search heads (for distributed search)
- Licenses for cluster members (for index replication)
