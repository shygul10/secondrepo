EC2
Is a way we can run virtual servers in the cloud.
Ec2 hosts are managed by aws. an ec2 instance is a virtual server(website,windows OS).
Ec2 instances run windows, linux, or macOS.
Selection of instances types comes with varying combinations of CPU, memoey , storage and networking.
======================================================================================
Launching an EC2 Instance:
The instance type defines the hardware profile (and cost)
An AMI defines the configuration of the instance
An snapshot is a point in time backup of an instance. 
You can customize your instance and create custom AMI.
======================================================================================
Ec2 user data and meta data
USER DATA:
[#!/bin/bash
yum update -y
yum install -y httpd
systemctl start httpd
systemctl enable httpd
EC2ID=$(curl -s http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/instance-id)
echo '<center><h1>The instance ID of this Amazon EC2 instance is: EC2ID </h1></center>' >/var/www/html/index.txt
sed "s/EC2ID/$EC2ID/" /var/www/html/index.txt > /var/www/html/index.html]
this code helps to installing a web service.
it will limited 16kb
ec2 instance with a webservice is launched 
batch and power shell scripts can be run on windows.

User data gives the ability to run commands when the system is starting and meta data can return the information thats recorded locally.
======================================================================================
EC2 placement group
Cluster - uses enhanced nw,low nw latency and high throughput for inter instance traffic. 
Partition - Each partition is located on seperated AWS rack.Partitions can be in multipe AZs(up to 7 per AZ)
Spread - Small number of critical instances that should be kept seperate from each other.
==============================================================
Elastic NW Interface(ENI)
Basic adapter type for when we dont have any high performance requirements.
Can use with all instance types.
Elastic NW adapter (ENA)
Enhanced nw performance
Higher bandwidth and lower inter instance latency
Must choose supported instance type
Elastic Fabric Adapter(EFA)
Use with High performance
computing and MPI (message passing Interface) and ML (machine learning)use cases
Tightly coupled appps
can use all instance types

Stop and Stop Hibernnate(SH) ---> SH is only applicable to EBS backed Instances.	
		
Hibernating EC2 Instancces 
 Applies to on demand or reserved linux instannces

Update --> Per second is now also available for windows instances
