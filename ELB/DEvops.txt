Continous Integrationn is Automated process in devops
Code stores in centralized repo is called version contrl system (github)
the code will be moved to build server on build server it will build tested and evaluated through artifact
this will be stored in software repo

Advantage or Goal of CI process is detect defects at a very early stages so it does not multiply
Identify 
Bugs 
Issues
(fully automated)
